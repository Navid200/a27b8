## Why is xDrip not in the Google play store?  
  
There was a [request](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/issues/693) to move xDrip to the app store a few years ago.  
The reasons for not doing that are explained there.  
Please read the details.  If you feel you have a reason for or against that is not included, you can post in it.  But, please don't post there just as a vote.  

You can always open a [discussion](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/discussions) about this or any other subject related to xDrip.
