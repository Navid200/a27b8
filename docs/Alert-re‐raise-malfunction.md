## Alert re-raise malfunction  
  
If you are using the [ascending volume profile](./Ascending-volume-profile.md), and you have set re-raise every x minutes, in one of your alerts, to anything other than 1, you may think that xDrip is malfunctioning.  

When you use the ascending volume profile, the alert will go off once every minute with increasing volume every minute until you snooze the alert.  The fact that it is repeating every minute is not a malfunction of the re-raise setting; it is a requirement of the chosen ascending volume profile.  

Therefore, this is not really a malfunction.  It is the intended behavior.
